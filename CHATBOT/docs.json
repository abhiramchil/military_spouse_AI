  "Civilian Employment Assignment Tool (CEAT)\n\nCivilian Employment Assignment Tool (CEAT) The Non-Appropriated (NAF) Civilian Employment Assignment Tool (CEAT) enables many current NAF employees to voluntarily request a non-competitive transfer to another Army installation where the same position may be available. What is CEAT? CEAT is a program that allows many current NAF employees to voluntarily request a non-competitive transfer to another Army installation where the same position may be available. CEAT applies to NAF employees in the following categories: Child and Youth Program Assistants (CYPAs) NF-03 and below NAF FWS – NA, NL, and NS pay bands Can I stay employed with Family and Morale, Welfare and Recreation (MWR) when the military moves my Family? Yes! Eligible employees can now request a transfer to another installation through CEAT. But you can use CEAT for any reason, not just a PCS. How does CEAT work? Inform your supervisor of your intent to relocate and request leave without pay as applicable. Complete the CEAT transfer request form with your supervisor or Human Resources Office (HRO) (if not relocated). Complete the CEAT transfer request form with the gaining HRO if relocated to the new duty location. Do my background checks follow me to my new location? Yes. When you accept a position at a new location without a break in service of more than 24 months, your previous background checks will be verified by the gaining servicing NAF Human Resource Office (HRO). If the last background checks are over 24 months old, consult your HRO. Do I have to resign before moving? No. CEAT allows you to continue with Family and MWR without a break in service. Even if it takes a little while to get settled, you’re authorized one year leave without pay to look for a job. Are there any other eligibility requirements? Signing up for the transfer is voluntary. If you had a performance evaluation of “Satisfactory” or higher and no disciplinary/adverse actions within 12 months of initiating the transfer request, you are eligible to register. Employees with disciplinary/adverse actions that are under appeal are not eligible to request transfer through CEAT until the appeal is resolved. Ready to Register for CEAT? Completion of the following questionnaire will indicate your desire to transfer. If you submit data in error, please contact your servicing personnel office. Thank you for your continued interest in Army CYS! Next Steps: Need more information? View the Frequently Asked Questions below for more details. Download the CEAT Transfer Guide . Ready to apply? Start the questionnaire. (CAC login required) Additional Videos and Tutorials: CEAT Orientation for Employees: - MilSuite - requires CAC authentication - YouTube - for off-network viewing FAQ CEAT FAQ What is CEAT? CEAT enables current NAF employees voluntarily request a non-competitive transfer to another Army installation at the same grade/pay level and employment category. Will an employee’s background checks follow when they get to their new location? Yes. When an employee moves from one installation to another, and accepts a position without a break in service of more than 24 months, their previous background checks will be verified by the gaining servicing Non-Appropriated Fund (NAF) Human Resource Office (HRO). If it has been more than 24 months since the last background checks were completed consult with your HR office. Who is responsible for completing the employee transfer form? The current employee, losing manager, losing HRO and gaining HRO are all responsible for sections of the employee transfer form. Will an employee’s employment category change upon transfer? No, the employment category will not change upon transfer. What can an employee do if there are no positions available for transfer? If a non-competitive transfer (position) is not available, you may apply for NAF jobs using USA Jobs , at local job fairs, or through your servicing NAF Human Resources (HR) Division. How can HR view employees coming to their Garrison in the CEAT query tool? Be sure to save the query tool on your desktop prior to opening in order to search the list applicants by location. Due to firewalls in place with AKO currently the macros are being removed from the excel spreadsheet Will pay remain the same upon transfer? Your pay may increase or remain the same based on the new duty location. Is an employee eligible to transfer without a performance evaluation? No, an employee must have a performance evaluation to transfer. An employee can receive an evaluation after 90 days. Prior to registering in CEAT ensure you have received an evaluation from your supervisor. What happens after an employee registers in CEAT? Once registered in CEAT the employee will complete the transfer request form and submit to the losing manager. The employee should also retain a copy for their records. What happens to the employee transfer request form after an employee has transferred? After an employee has successfully transferred the transfer request form is kept with the rest of the employee case file. Ask Army Answers",

  "School Support Services & Homeschools\n\nSchool Support Services & Homeschools School Support Services provides Army school-aged youth with educational opportunities, resources and information necessary to achieve academic success. A branch of Child & Youth Services (CYS), School Support Services features School Liaison Officers (SLOs), who help schools, installations and Families work together for student achievement. SLOs are your best support in the area of education, schools and military transitions. SLOs are knowledgeable in current education news and policies. They act as the conduit between the school community – including local public school districts, private schools and home school Families – and the installation. 2025/2026 School Calendar: Schools include DoDEA, Muscogee, Harris, Chattco, Phenix City, Russell and Lee Counties. How can your School Liaison help? Helping schools understand the challenges military Families face Informing parents about local school policies and PCS transitions Giving Families information about local schools, graduation requirements, after school programs, youth sponsorship and homeschooling Connecting units and schools through partnership initiatives Conducting workshops to help parents navigate educational transition and advocate for their children Providing an array of resources that benefit military youth and improve school experiences Establishing school and community partnerships Providing information about colleges and other post-secondary opportunities and preparation materials Youth Sponsorship Does your child have 101 questions about your next duty station? Let a youth sponsor answer them! Youth sponsors connect with children before arrival at a new duty station, provide them with information about their new communities and answer questions from a youth perspective – while being guided by adults in the CYS youth program and the schools. Once you arrive, a youth sponsor will meet your child and can arrange community and school tours. If you're preparing for a PCS move, contact your SLO today to sign up for a youth sponsor. Finding a School Finding a new school and registering your child can be confusing. We can help. Our SLOs give you information on local schools so you can find the best fit for you and your family.   They can also help you with everything you need to register – and can answer other questions, too. Contact our office and to get more detailed information. Research-based Characteristics of Quality Schools Most schools share fundamental characteristics that prepare students for the future. Research shows that the most effective schools are more alike than they are different. Here is some information about what to look for in quality schools: Five Key Features of Effective Schools The United States Department of Education provides detailed information about choosing a school and offers a great number of resources to help you make an informed decision when choosing a school for your child . Schools (K-12) Fort Benning, GA Chattahoochee County, GA Muscogee County, GA Harris County, GA Russell County, AL Phenix City, AL Lee County, AL Fort Benning has one middle and four elementary schools. School districts surrounding Fort Benning serve our high school students. Which school is best? How do I choose? Elementary and middle school students on post will be assigned to a school near their housing community. High school students on post have a variety of options, including Russell County in Alabama, and in Georgia, Chattahoochee County and nine schools in Muscogee County. There are many private and faith-based schools within a 30-mile radius. To make a well informed decision, visit prospective schools, visit the school website, talk to teachers, students and administrators, and gain an overall sense of the school’s academic, social, and emotional environment. If you do not live on post, your choice of school may determine where you decide to live. Most high schools in Muscogee County offer a magnet program, and potential students may apply (a process that sometimes includes a test and interview) to attend a magnet program outside of their assigned district. How do I register? School registration will take place at the school to which you are zoned. Kindergarten students must be at least 5 years old on or before Sept. 1, and first-graders must be at least 6 years old. Students who turn 6 years old after Sept. 2, have successfully completed public kindergarten in another state, and have been certified to attend first grade in that state may be accepted in first grade. For more information, please visit the specific school district. For schools on post, you will need your current orders to verify active duty status and a lease agreement or memorandum from the Housing Office verifying that you are assigned to Fort Moore housing or will be assigned within 90 days. On post or off, you may need: proof of residency (mortgage, rental agreement, government mail, utility bill, etc.) school records and/or previous school’s mailing address Social Security Card certified copy of birth certificate immunization records on Georgia Form 3231 Eye, Ear, and Dental screening on Georgia Form EED Do I have to live on post for my student to attend on-post schools? Yes, only post residents with students in grades PK-8 may attend Fort Moore Schools. To which school is my high-schooler assigned? If you live on post, your high school student may attend Spencer High School, Chattahoochee County Middle High School or Russell County High School in Alabama. Transportation is provided to all high schools in Muscogee County and Chattahoochee Middle High School. Your student may wish to attend a magnet program in one of the Muscogee County High Schools. A magnet school is a public school that helps a child focus on an interest or career, such as liberal arts, science, technology, etc. The Muscogee County School District offers nine magnet programs in its high schools: Columbus High School Early College Academy Carver High School Hardaway High School Jordan High School Kendrick High School Northside High School Shaw High School Spencer High School Why aren’t requirements the same from district to district? Each local school district is obliged to meet state requirements for learning standards, including standards for students seeking promotion and graduation. These requirements vary from state to state and often put our transitioning students in jeopardy of graduating on time. We hope you will visit the Military Child Education Coalition web page to seek tips on preparing your child for transitioning from school to school. The Department of Defense is also working with the states to ease the burden placed on transitioning families. Visit www.USA4militaryfamilies.dod.mil for more information. Homeschool Homeschool families on post are invited to join us for a weekly meeting. For information, call +1 (706)545-2079 .

School Support Services works with on-post homeschool families to provide access to homework help and post facilities, when available, during the school year. The School Liaison provides a link between homeschool families and local resources. Homeschool families on post are subject to the requirements of the Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) and Georgia or Alabama home schooling regulations. If a family resides off the installation, they are subject to requirements of the state. For homeschooling information for the state of Georgia, go to the Georgia Department of Education website or the Alabama Department of Education website. Homeschool students can receive auxiliary services (if available) from on-post schools if they reside on the installation. Auxiliary services may include the use of academic resources such as textbooks, library books, standardized tests, software and internet access through school media centers. Homeschool students may participate in music, arts and interscholastic activities that occur between schools. Services for homeschool children living off the installation vary from school to school.

We have a number of resources to help make your move as easy as possible for the kids, including: Military Kids Connect provides online age-appropriate resources to help parents, teachers and children cope with the unique challenges of military life. The Interstate Compact on Educational Opportunity for Military Children (MIC3) addresses key transition issues military Families experience, including enrollment, placement, attendance, eligibility and graduation. All 50 states have signed the compact and are in varying stages of implementation and/or compliance. The compact applies to children of Active Duty service members, National Guard and Reserve members on active duty orders and members or veterans who are medically discharged or retired within past year. If you feel that you have an issue that the Compact can help address talk with your SLO.  The SLO is able to assist by connecting with both the sending and receiving school to assist in resolving the issue.  If it is not possible to resolve the issue locally, the SLO will help you work with the state commission, and if needed, the national office. Post - Secondary Support Our support doesn’t end with elementary education. If you have children preparing for academic life after high school, we can help you find information about testing opportunities, scholarships and military-specific resources that can help you plan.

In-State Tuition Programs for Military: Service-members, active duty for a period of more than 30 days and their dependents are eligible to receive in-state tuition at many public colleges and universities in the state where they reside or are permanently stationed. An enrolled dependent may pay in-state tuition as long as he or she remains continuously enrolled at the institution, even if the service-member is reassigned outside of the state. Regulations outlined in the Higher Education Opportunity Act, 2008 (P.L 110 - 135 ) and the Higher Education Act of 1965 (pdf) apply.

The goal is to develop viable and sustainable partnerships that focus on problem identification, process improvement and solutions. Meeting Minutes Review the meeting minutes from the November 2, 2021 meeting . Frequently Asked Questions What is a Unique Military Child Identifier? Numerous states have enacted a voluntary report-only self-identification of military children within their public school systems. This data collection would allow monitoring of critical elements such as academic progress and proficiency, special and advanced program participation, mobility and dropout rates. Requirements and method of collection vary from state to state. Impact Aid Many local school districts across the United States include within their boundaries parcels of land that are owned by the Federal Government.  They must provide a quality education to the children living on the Indian and other Federal lands while sometimes operating with less local revenue than is available to other school districts, because the Federal property is exempt from local property taxes. Congress has provided financial assistance to these local school districts through the Impact Aid Program. Each year Military members and Federal employees complete a Survey Form. The amount of Impact Aid – or federal assistance –received is determined by the number of eligible parents/guardians who complete the survey form. It partially compensates school districts affected by federal activity for local tax losses resulting from tax-free federal installations. Impact Aid Fact Sheet (we will provide a hand out to link to) Impact Aid Website Non-DoD School Program (NDSP) At overseas/international locations where there is not a Department of Defense Education Activity (DoDEA) school, NDSP supports a variety of options for your children, ranging from public or private schools to homeschool programs.  NDSP has a team of education specialists who are available to provide transition and educational support and coordination for all students, including those with special needs.

  "Recycle Program\n\nRecycle Program The Qualified Recycling Program (QRP) recycles many common items such as scrap metal, paper, cardboard and plastic.  Our mission is to reduce the impact that our on-post community has on the environment through recycling material that would otherwise end up in a landfill.  With your help, we can have a positive impact on our community. For bulk trash pick-up information, visit Villages at Fort Benning website or their Facebook page . How to Recycle Recyclable items can be dropped at one of our convenient locations.  We have a primary collection point behind the MWR carwash at the Commissary with multiple blue dumpsters for your convenience.  Boxes must be broken down to conserve space.  We also receive this material at our Material Recovery Facility (MRF) on Jamestown Road at BLDG M0298.  You can also use our recycling collection trailers around the installation.  The location of these trailers can be found below and are used for general collection of material. Why Recycle One of the best things about our program is the fact that we sell recyclable material and maintain that money right here on Fort Benning.  The funds are used for projects such as the bike & walking paths, currently being expanded, as well as distributions to MWR for programs that help our soldiers and their families right here.  In FY22, The QRP was able to fund $2.1 million to the Fort Benning MWR and $1 million to various projects on the installation. What We Do and How We Do It Single Stream - We use a single stream recycling process to collect SOME material around the installation.  This type of process is designed to collect paper, cardboard, aluminum and tin cans as well as plastic bottles (liquid holding bottles such as milk, laundry detergent and drinks). Scrap Metal – We recycle scrap metal from various buildings on the installation and also will receive this type of material at our MRF on Jamestown Road. Cardboard – Our program receives large quantities of cardboard from significant generating activities around the installation.  We bale this cardboard and sell it onsite at our MRF. Brass – One of the largest contributors to our QRP is expended brass from Fort Benning's ranges.  Each time you hear the sound of Soldiers training to defend our freedom, just know that they pick up the brass casings when they get done shooting on the range and we turn them back into dollars for Fort Benning. Dangers of Contaminates Unacceptable items like animal carcasses, needles/sharps, ammunition, large plastics, metal (other than food and drink cans), food and liquid waste, diapers, urine samples, and hazardous materials like lithium batteries, gasoline, and oil regularly contaminate loads of quality recyclables, resulting in it being rejected and redirected to be disposed of as trash.  Tanglers, such as plastic bags, textiles, rope, hoses, wires, and cords will interfere with sorting equipment and can also result in an entire load being sent to the landfill. Many of these contaminates can injure our team members, who are connected to the military community as a Family member, veteran and/or spouse.

Efforts were made by the QRP to salvage the agreement but ultimately the city was unable to continue. We do apologize but housing is not part of the QRP collection area and we do not possess the equipment needed to collect the containers therein.

Mad Games Now available at the Mall Bowling Center and the Bowling & Entertainment Center! Many young bowlers find the 10-frame format too long and the scoring calculation rules too difficult and too hard to understand. The traditional grid isn’t appealing or exciting.  While they may try a game or two, a lot won’t come back and that’s a tragedy – because bowling is and can be so much Fun! We are happy to announce to offer Mad Games at the Mall Bowling and the Bowling & Entertainment Center! What exactly is Mad Games?  Mad Games are shorter and easier to understand bowling games for our younger bowlers, ages 12 and under.  When you bowl a Mad Game, the scoring system is simpler, and the bowling pace is way faster.  We offer four different Mad Games to choose from: Monster Factory Character Factory Bowlin’ Hood Battle on the Lanes Mad Games themes are Videogame-like, 2D and 3D visuals – of course that’s way more interesting and more fun as regular bowling!  And the best – at the end, bowlers can take home a picture of themselves bowling – which the Mad Game system provides! Try something new and visit the Mall Bowling and the Bowling & Entertainment Center for our new Mad Games – fun, excitement and an unforgettable experience promised!  Mad Games is open to everyone, but perfect for our younger bowlers, children 12 and under.

You’re ready to bowl! But wait - bowling is harder than it looks!  What is the right bowling ball for you? How do you stand before you swing and release the ball?  Do you always wanted to learn how to bowl but never found an instructor who could teach you? We can help!

This league is open to everyone, kids, adults, friends, neighbors, everyone who has access to the installation! Get ready to learn to bowl, below you’ll find the 10 most important bowling tips for beginners: Don’t aim for the pins! Seriously, resist the urge! The best way to get a strike is by aiming for the pocket—the space between the 1 and 3 pins, or the space between the 2 and 4 pins. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart! Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and take a few steps forward so that only your toes are touching the line. Swing the ball by keeping your arm straight! Bending your elbow will decrease both accuracy and power. Release the ball by curling your fingers so that the ball spins as it rolls down the lane. This will give you better control and accuracy. Timing is everything! As the ball hits the pins, watch carefully so you can time your next throw accordingly. If you act too quickly, you may end up standing in front of fallen pins (which isn’t fun for anyone). If you wait too long, other bowlers may get frustrated because they must wait for you to clear the lane before they can bowl their turn. Always keep your eye on the ball! This may seem like a no-brainer but it’s important, nonetheless. Once you release the ball, resist the urge to watch it roll down the lane—you need to be able to see where it’s going so you can adjust on your next turn if necessary. Make sure your hand position is correct! Avoid “cutting” when walking up to bowl! If possible, walk in a straight line so that other bowlers can clearly see what you’re doing and avoid running into you by accident! Pay attention! MOST IMPORTANTLY - Have fun! At the end of the day, bowling is meant to be enjoyable, so don’t take yourself too seriously. Enjoy yourself, relax, and let those strikes come naturally. For more information or any questions, please contact the Mall Bowling Center!

During the installation's early days, Russ Pool drew crowds from all across the Chattahoochee Valley. Back then, it was one of the area’s most popular swimming areas. Today, swimming is no longer permitted at the \"pool,\" which has been converted into a fishing spot right next to the original Russ Pond. Although fishing in Russ Pool and Pond is reserved for children 15 and younger, they'll likely need a little help from Mom or Dad. There are playgrounds on either side of Russ Pool, shaded gazebos, a nine-hole, par-3 disc golf course, a fitness trail that's nearly a mile long, and two pavilions available for use by reservation. Building 300 is an open pavilion with picnic tables that accommodate up to 30 people. It is well-lit, with restrooms, electricity and water, a large charcoal grill and a fireplace.

Campbell King Horse Bowl The Campbell King Horse Show Bowl was built in 1930 and operated primarily through the 1930s and ‘40s, when horse sportsmanship was popular. It is built adjacent to the old Infantry School corrals and stables in an area with folding terrain that accommodates raised seating on opposite sides of a center arena.   The defining features are the stone walls that form the central arena and the terraced seating. During the height of its use, there were regular competitions of horse jumping, riding, for all ages and skill levels.  It was also used for Easter Sunrise services, in which thousands would attend.  The era of the Army horse died at Fort Benning, now Fort Benning, in 1947, when the government horses were auctioned off.  Only privately owned horses remained, so use was greatly reduced.  Eventually the Bowl fell into disuse, with only sporadic attempts to revive.  It is now undergoing a major renovation to restore it and add modern conveniences.  It was named after Brigadier General Campbell King, an early Fort Benning, now called Fort Benning, Commander who was an avid horseman.

NRA Basic Pistol Course The Recreational Shooting Complex offers monthly an 8-hours NRA Basic Pistol Course (BoPS); the course is held by an NRA Certified Instructor and consists of classroom hours, NRA BoPS student materials as well as a live-fire exercise on the range. After completing the course and passing the standard NRA test, participants will be certified as basic pistol shooter by the NRA .  Certifying courses are important to benchmark the progress of beginning shooters, as well as mandatory in some states to apply for weapons carrying cards, or to purchase firearms at all.  NRA courses are among the most universally accepted standards of training for firearms handling, marksmanship, and safety. During the classroom portion, the following five NRA lessons – followed by a NRA standard test that must be passed - are covered: Lesson I: Pistol Knowledge & Safe Gun Handling Lesson II: Ammunition Knowledge & The Fundamentals of Pistol Shooting Lesson III: Shooting Positions & Shooting Qualification Lesson IV: Scoring Targets & Selecting Your Pistol Lesson IV: Continued Opportunities for Skill Development Following the classroom hours and passing the NRA standard test, a live-fire exercise will be completed to ensure students learned the fundamentals of marksmanship and safety. Students start the live-fire exercise with instructed warm-up drills.  The pistol qualification live-fire exercise on NRA standard targets consists of the following: For Level 1 Qualification:  From a bench rest position, students will place 5 shots within a 4-inch target placed 10 feet from the front of the bench. For Level 2 Qualification:  From a bench rest position, students will place 5 shots within a 4-inch target placed 15 feet from the front of the bench. For Level 3 Qualification:  From a bench rest position, students will place 5 shots within a 4-inch target placed 20 feet from the front of the bench. Once completed, each student who qualified on their live-fire exercise, will be certified as a basic pistol shooter by the NRA and receive their official NRA certificate of completion. The course also covers parts of MCoE Regulation Number 190-11 (Physical Security of Privately Owned Arms, Ammunition, and Explosives), with focus on the registration of Privately Owned Firearms (POFs), requirements for storage, and requirements for transporting POFs on the installation.

DVAM Signed Proclamation DVAM Signed Letter For more information, please contact the Family Advocacy program at +1 (706) 545-6316 . Military Family Appreciation Month Every November, the nation comes together to celebrate Military Family Appreciation Month, a time dedicated to honoring the unwavering strength, resilience, and sacrifice of the families who stand behind America’s service members. While the courage of soldiers, the quiet endurance of their spouses, children, parents, and loved ones is equally worthy of our gratitude. Military life is not only a commitment made by the service member—it’s a commitment made by the entire family. Spouses navigate long separations, unpredictable moves, and the daily responsibilities of home life, often without the immediate presence of their partner. Children adapt to new schools, say frequent goodbyes to friends, and cope with the emotional weight of having a parent deployed. Join FAP in their upcoming events for the month of November as they show their support and appreciation to Military families! For more information, contact the Family Advocacy Program at 706-544-7233 (SAFE) or visit 7131 Richardson Circle, Building 36.

Reconsideration Request Instructions An alleged abuser, victim, or a parent on behalf of a child victim may request reconsideration in writing to the IDC chair, through the Family Advocacy Program manager (FAPM) within 30 calendar days of notification of the outcome of their case at the incident determination committee (IDC). It is imperative requestors follow the step-by-step process established on HQDA EXORD 156-21 (FRAGO 1) Annex F, Coordinating Instructions IDC Reconsiderations 27 May 2022 to submit their reconsideration request. This structured approach offers a standardized way to request a review of IDC cases. Before seeking a reconsideration, it is essential requestors fully comprehend the aspects of the investigation’s findings and decision tree algorithm (DTA) by consulting their FAP-C case manager. The request for reconsideration must be supported by fresh evidence or specify procedural errors that occurred during the IDC meeting.  Clear outline of the request may enhance its validity by establishing a solid reason for review.  However, refusal to meet with the FAP-C case manager prior to the IDC or providing information that was previously withheld from the case manager does not constitute ‘new information.’  It is the responsibility of the requestor and their commander to ensure the treatment plan developed by the FAP-C is adhered to.  Reconsideration request is not a reason to suspend nor delay treatment. Requestors must submit their request in writing utilizing the format outlined in Annex H. Requests that do not adhere to this format will not be submitted to the garrison commander and returned to the requestor. If a requestor had several incidents at the IDC, a separate request for each incident is required.  Requests and supporting documentation must be emailed to the Fort Benning FAPM beatriz.e.seales-tealdi.civ@army.mil , within 30 calendar days of the requestor being notified of the outcome of their case.

Go over your safety plan. Reporting Domestic Abuse Reporting Options :  The Army is fully committed to ensuring victims of domestic abuse are protected; treated with dignity and respect; and provided support, advocacy and care. The Army strongly supports effective command awareness and prevention programs, and holding offenders accountable. There are two types of reporting options: Restricted Reporting and Unrestricted Reporting. Personnel should report all suspected cases of domestic abuse promptly, which quickly activates victim services and accountability actions. However, we understand things might not always work that way. Victims might need medical attention or victim services without command or a law enforcement response. Therefore, the Army has implemented a Restricted Reporting Option for victims to confidentially disclose allegations of abuse and receive needed medical treatment and services. Restricted Reporting: Allows someone who meets VAP criteria and who is experiencing violence in his/her relationship to confidentially disclose the abuse to a Victim Advocate, a Victim Advocate Supervisor, or a Healthcare Provider. When an individual chooses a restricted report, law enforcement is not involved and there is no investigation of the abuse. In addition, the Soldier’s Command is not notified of the abuse and is unable to offer assistance and protection. The restricted reporting option allows an individual to receive medical treatment, advocacy services and clinical and pastoral counseling. This option allows one to receive needed services, control the release of his/her personal information, and time to consider his/her options. Under this reporting option, the offender is not held accountable and the abuse may continue. If an assessment reveals a high risk for future injury, a restricted report may not be granted. Unrestricted Reporting: Victims of domestic abuse who want to pursue an official investigation of an incident should report the abuse to law enforcement, or the alleged offender’s Commander. The unrestricted reporting option provides a victim with the widest array of services available including but not limited to command involvement, law enforcement involvement, medical treatment, advocacy services, and counseling services. Not all incidents of domestic abuse are the same, and each person who experiences domestic abuse handles the situation differently. Command Response: Commanders play an integral part in ensuring the safety, health, and well being of our Army Families. Commanders who learn of an incident of domestic abuse are required to notify law enforcement. Victim’s Rights The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for your dignity and privacy. The right to be reasonably protected from the accused offender. The right to be notified of court proceedings. The right to be present at all public court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court determines that your testimony would be materially affected if you, as the victim, heard other testimony at trial. The right to confer with the attorney for the government in the case; the right to available restitution; the right to information about the conviction, sentencing, imprisonment, and release of the offender. Safety Planning: A violent relationship puts you and your children at risk for injury and even death. Developing a safety plan tailored to meet the needs of your family will enable you get out of a potentially dangerous situation. If your children are old enough, mature enough, or even responsible enough to assist you during a violent or potentially violent episode of domestic abuse, you may consider including them in your plan to keep everyone safe. A good safety plan considers which steps to take if you choose to stay in the relationship or if you choose to leave. Here are some tips during the explosive phase of domestic abuse: Move to a room with easy access to an exit. Don't go to the kitchen, bathroom or near possible weapons. Know the quickest route out of your home. Practice escaping that way. Know the quickest route out of your workplace. Practice escaping that way. Domestic violence does not just occur in your home. Pack a bag and have it ready. Keep it hidden but make it easy to grab quickly. Tell your neighbors about your abuse and ask them to call the police when they hear a disturbance. Have a code word to use with your kids, family and friends. They will know to call the police and get you help. Know where you are going to go, if you ever have to leave. Use your instincts. You have the right to protect yourself and your children. Develop a Safety Plan Safety Plan (English) Safety Plan (Spanish)- Plan de seguridad (español) Protection Orders Military Protection Orders (MPO): Unit Commanders may issue a Military Protective Order (MPO) to ensure the safety of service members, family members, and other individuals from the threat of domestic violence. An MPO is a written lawful order issued by a commander that orders a Soldier to avoid contact with his or her spouse or children. The commander should provide a written copy of the order within 24 hours of its issuance to the protected person, the Military Police and civilian law enforcement. An individual should report violations of the MPO to law enforcement. Civilian Protection Orders (CPO): A Civilian Order of Protection is an order signed by a Judge that directs an individual to stop abusing, stalking, harassing and/or committing acts of sexual violence against an individual. An individual may file a CPO against current or former spouse, someone that an individual shares a child in common, an individual with whom you have shared a residence with, someone related to you by blood or marriage or someone with whom you have dated or had intimate relations.

Victim Advocacy The Victim Advocacy Program (VAP) provides emergency and follow-up support services to adult victims of domestic abuse. Advocacy services are available to Service members, their current or former spouses, an individual with whom the Service member shares a child, and significant others of Service members who live together. Our services are available twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. Our trained professionals are here for crisis response, information on reporting options, medical treatment options, law enforcement’s response, emergency services, safety planning, obtaining military and civilian protective orders, and accompaniment to medical forensic exams and medical appointments, as well as accompaniment to court for orders of protection hearings and trials. Advocates work closely with their civilian counterparts and ensure a personal and smooth transition for victims who do not qualify for ongoing advocacy services within the military community. If you need help or want more information, contact the Victim Advocacy Program Manager at your local Army Community Service Center. What is partner abuse? Partner abuse is pattern of behavior resulting in emotional or psychological abuse, economic control or interference with personal liberty. Spouse or partner abuse can include something as obvious as a slap or a hit, but also includes less noticeable controlling, threatening or emotionally abusive behaviors. No one should stay in a relationship where he or she is being physically or emotionally abused by a partner or spouse. I suspect my friend is a victim? What should I do? Please encourage your friend to seek professional help through the Family Advocacy Program. Do not attempt to resolve the situation by yourself. Domestic violence is a very complex and dangerous issue. What about my privacy? The military is committed to protecting the victim’s privacy. Depending on the severity of the situation, a victim has a reasonable expectation of confidentiality if he or she first contacts a victim advocate or health care provider at one of the on-post clinics or Martin Army Community Hospital. In cases where there is an obvious danger or imminent threat of harm, or in the case of child abuse, a care provider may have to notify others to ensure the safety of all persons involved. Abuse victims worried about their privacy can call for assistance and remain anonymous until they feel comfortable about their options. Is there help for the abuser? Many spouses would like to find help for their abusive partner, and the abuser may welcome it. Marriage or couples counseling is often not a good choice, but there are other very good options, including support groups or counseling designed specifically for abusers. What is the commander's role? Commanders and other leaders are required to report, to seek help for all parties involved and to help ensure safety to the fullest extent possible. Commanders and the military or local police may document the abuse, arrest the offender, secure a military or civilian no-contact/protective order for the victim, find legal assistance and order the offender into treatment. Although commanders are concerned about the safety of families in their units, they cannot help if they don’t know there is a problem. Out of fear that a report will damage a Soldier’s career, victims may not come forward unless they are provided an option to keep their situation completely private. How are children affected by domestic abuse? Children usually know something is not right, even if they haven’t witnessed violence. They may show different reactions according to their age. Most offenders have learned their behavior from growing up in an abusive home of their own. Younger children may blame themselves and feel guilt, shame and anxiety. They may become withdrawn, less talkative, and they may exhibit regressed behaviors such as clinging and whining. Difficulties eating and sleeping, concentration problems and physical complaints (e.g., headaches) may also occur. Ways to report: Restricted – Allows victims the option of receiving medical treatment, advocacy and counseling without an official investigation or command involvement. Unrestricted – Victims receive medical treatment, advocacy, counseling and an official investigation of their allegation. This option ensures the widest range of rights and protections to the victim. Shelters: There is a shelter available in the community for female victims of abuse and their children. Victims who fear the loss of income if a Soldier is arrested or kicked out of the Army may take comfort in knowing that the military has programs that may offer financial support.

Spouse abuse prevention programs help develop communication, decision making and conflict resolution skills. Strategies may include educational programs and interactive workshops on communication, conflict resolution, assertiveness, stress management and marital enrichment, as well as programs for children who witness violence. Programs for single Soldiers and adolescents teach similar topics such as relationship skills, dating, violence awareness and sexual harassment. Command Education Program: Within 45 days of taking command, commanders at all levels will receive a briefing on the FAP and Sexual Assault Program. Information will be provided on policies, procedures, available resources, command responsibilities in the areas of identification, reporting, coordination, rehabilitation, and administrative or judicial options. Troop Education: Mandatory classes are provided annually on the dynamics of spouse and child abuse, the availability of treatment and the Army’s policies regarding family violence. Education for Professionals: The FAP provides training to mental health professionals on a variety of topics affecting Families, teens and children.  Visit our Facebook page to learn about on-going trainings. Safety Education Programs: There are two target groups for safety education. The first target group is composed of parents, teachers, caregivers and all concerned adults who need information about how to protect children and communicate with them about child abuse. The second target group, children and teens, need programs and activities geared to their ability to understand and act on safety and exploitation issues including child abuse. Education programs should help children develop skills to protect themselves against abuse. These programs may include other community efforts such as finger printing and neighborhood safe house programs. Family Life Education: This is education focusing on enrichment programs that provide knowledge, social relationship skills and support throughout the family life cycle. The goal is to improve life management and family coping skills, enhance self-esteem, and improve communication skills and marital relationships. Family life education overlaps with spouse and child abuse prevention programming and is often shared with the chapel and other installation agencies. Parent Education Program: This program involves education that is designed to enhance parenting and child management skills. Parent education and support groups may be combined to provide a forum for parents to exchange ideas, information and resources and to practice new behaviors. The program also may reinforce or teach basic skills in physical care, protection, supervision and psychological nurturing appropriate to a child’s age and stage of development. Respite Care Respite care is temporary child care for the purpose of relieving parental stress and to provide a nurturing and developmentally appropriate environment. Families may receive respite care when both Soldier and spouse attend parenting classes, counseling, support groups, or are experiencing stress from deployment related or family issues. Respite care will not be used in place of foster care or abandoned children. First Steps Program A primary prevention program that provides emotional support, parenting education, referrals to community resources, and follow-up contact to parents with newborns. The program activities include screenings, information and referral, clinic and hospital visits, respite support and other services as needed. Sexual Harassment/Assault Response and Prevention (SHARP) Program The SHARP Program’s mission is to reduce with an aim toward eliminating sexual offenses within the Army through cultural change, prevention, intervention, investigation, accountability, advocacy/response, assessment, and training to sustain the All-Volunteer Force. SHARP provides crisis intervention and support services to victims of sexual assault, 24 hours per day, 7 days a week. Trained victim advocates provide a helping hand through support, critical information and referrals for services on post and in the community. Advocates assist survivors in determining what they wish to do and where to get help, whether they choose to report the assault or not. They accompany survivors to medical visits, court proceedings and other appointments as requested. The SHARP also provides education and awareness trainings to active duty members, family members, DOD civilians and contract personnel on how to stay safe and what to do if assault occurred. Sexual Assault Response Coordinator & Victim Advocate: Sexual Assault Response Coordinator & Victim Advocate: Sexual Assault Response Coordinators and Victim Advocates are vital to the success of the SHARP Program in preventing sexual harassment and sexual assault. SARCs and VAs provide mandatory training to Soldiers, Command, and Department of the Army Civilians. SARCs and VAs provide well-coordinated and highly responsive advocacy 24 hours per day/7 days per week both in Garrison and deployed environments. SARCs and VAs ensure that victims are aware of the reporting options (Restricted and Unrestricted) and provide support through the trauma of sexual harassment and/or sexual assault. Persons can reach a SARC or VA 24/7 via the Fort Benning SHARP hotline at +1 (706) 566-7393 . What is sexual harassment? What is sexual assault? Sexual harassment is a form of gender discrimination that involves unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature between the same or opposite genders. For military personnel, the working environment pertains 24/7, on or off post, and on or off duty. Intentional sexual contact characterized by use of force, threats, intimidation, or abuse of authority or when the victim does not or cannot consent. Sexual assault includes rape, forcible sodomy (oral or anal sex), and other unwanted sexual contact that is aggravated, abusive, or wrongful (including unwanted and inappropriate sexual contact), or attempts to commit these acts. [Source: Glossary, DoD 6495.01, 23 Jan 12] Consent is not given when a person uses force, threat of force, coercion or when the victim is asleep, incapacitated or unconscious. Sexual assault can occur without regard to gender, spousal relationship or age of victim. I've been assaulted. What should I do? Go to a safe location away from the perpetrator.  Preserve all evidence of the assault. Do not bathe, wash your hands or brush your teeth. If you are still where the crime occurred, do not clean, or straighten up, or remove anything from the crime scene.  Contact a Sexual Assault Response Coordinator (SARC) or Sexual Assault Prevention & Response Victim Advocate (SAPR VA).

What is the Reporting Procedure for Sexual Harassment? Soldiers: Report incidents of Sexual Harassment to their respective SARC. Department of the Army Civilians: DA Civilians, former employees, or applicants seeking employment, and certain contract employees who believe they have been subjected to sexual harassment can file an Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) complaint with a local Army EEO office. They must initiate contact with an EEO official or counselor within 45 days of the action or practice alleged to be discriminatory. Fort Benning EEO Office: +1 (706) 545-1872 The Army affords Soldiers and Adult Family Member victims of sexual assault with two reporting options: (HQDA EXORD 221-12 2012: Restricted report options were extended to Adult Dependent Family Members assaulted by someone other than a spouse or intimate partner.) Restricted : Sexual assault victims who want to confidentially disclose a sexual assault without triggering an official investigation can contact a SARC/SHARP Specialist, VA/SHARP Specialist, or a healthcare provider. By filing a restricted report with a SARC/SHARP Specialist, VA/SHARP Specialist, or a healthcare provider, a victim can disclose the sexual assault without triggering an official investigation AND receive medical treatment, advocacy services, legal assistance, and counseling. Victim conversations with a SARC/SHARP Specialist or VA/ SHARP Specialist about the sexual assault are confidential communications, not to be disclosed to others, including law enforcement or the chain of command, except in a few very rare circumstances. Discussing a sexual assault with a chaplain is not the same as filing a restricted report, but communications with a chaplain are privileged under Military Rule of Evidence 503 and AR 165-1. Unrestricted : This option is for victims of sexual assault who desire medical treatment, counseling, legal assistance, SARC/SHARP Specialist and VA/SHARP Specialist assistance, and an official investigation of the crime. When selecting unrestricted reporting, you may report the incident to the SARC/SHARP Specialist or VA/SHARP Specialist, request healthcare providers to notify law enforcement, contact law enforcement yourself, or use current reporting channels, e.g., chain of command. Upon notification of a reported sexual assault, the SARC/SHARP Specialist will immediately assign a VA/SHARP Specialist. You will also be advised of your right to access to legal assistance that is separate from prosecution resources. At the victim’s discretion/request, the healthcare provider shall conduct a sexual assault forensic examination (SAFE), which may include the collection of evidence. Details regarding the incident will be limited to only those personnel who have a legitimate need to know. Who can make a restricted report? Restricted reporting is available to military personnel, active duty, Reserve and National Guard, provided they are performing federal duty and their adult dependent family members.

Facebook | Twitter The Family Child Care (FCC) program is an integral part of the Child and Youth Services (CYS) child care system available on Army garrisons. FCC provides quality home based care for children 4 weeks to 12 years old and is offered in government owned and government leased housing located on post. FCC has unique qualities that make it a preferred choice for many families. It offers flexible hours: full day, part day, extended /overnight, weekend and hourly care in a comfortable home setting. FCC also offers a 15% cost savings compared to Child Development Centers and School Age Care fees FCC Providers are vetted and only the best qualified candidates are recommended for certification. Providers must complete background checks and regular home inspections as a part of certification. They also receive paid ongoing training for professional development. Army policy requires that anyone providing care on a regular basis for more than 10 hours per week, must be certified through Child and Youth Services as a FCC provider. Providing unauthorized child care in government owned/leased housing puts you at risk of losing your housing privileges.  Unauthorized child care by an uncertified person puts your child at risk.

It's Ok to Be Neighborly An explanation of the Family Child Care ten hour rule At Child and Youth Services, we provide safe child care for military Families – at Child Development Centers, and in Family Child Care (FCC) settings, where certified providers offer child care in their on-post homes. 2. The Army has a responsibility to balance the ability of families to rely on one another to meet their short term child care needs with protecting the safety and well-being of children. 3. It is not — and never has been — the intent of CYS to eliminate such “good neighbor” favors. 4. There is a difference between caring for children a few hours a week and providing child care services on a regular basis. Know the Rules A 10-hour child care limit has been established by the Department of the Army to protect children from being in unregulated child care settings on a regular basis. This means any Family member living in government quarters providing child care for more than 10 child care hours per week on a regular basis must be certified as a Family Child Care provider. “10 Child Care Hours means 1 child for 10 hours per week, 2 children for 5 hours per week, etc.” “Regular Basis” means routinely, for an extended period of time. SO … If you care for your neighbor’s child all day, 5 days per week for 9 hours per day, that is a total of 45 child care hours. You must be a certified FCC provider. OR … If you care for 6 different children per day, 5 days per week, even if it’s only an hour per day each, that is STILL a total of 30 child care hours. You must be a certified FCC provider. It pays to be a certified FCC provider! Certified FCC providers receive FREE training & support, FREE referrals, FREE materials & equipment AND qualify for child care subsidies! Become a certified FCC provider today! Contact your local CYS FCC Office. Already an FCC Provider? Transferring your FCC business from one post to another is a snap! Don’t stress over a PCS move! A few steps can get you set up as an FCC provider at your next duty station. Here’s what to do: First, make sure your future garrison has an active FCC program. If it does, you may be able to transfer your business. Submit an FCC Transfer Request to the losing garrison’s FCC director/administrator, who will review and send it on to HQ, IMCOM G9 CYS. Receive initial email or phone contact from the gaining garrison’s FCC director/administrator less than 30 days after they receive your inbound transfer. Continue to stay in touch until you arrive and are set up as an FCC provider. Meanwhile, your gaining garrison’s FCC director/administrator submits a transfer work order ticket to the supporting CDE office. A background check administrator also coordinates with the losing garrison for your file, determines whether re-verification is needed, and issues an updated Background Verification Checklist to the gaining installation. We want to make the transfer process as easy as possible for you. Because of that, we’re implementing this guidance across all IMCOM garrisons and spreading the news to all current and newly on-boarded FCC providers. If you are interested in becoming an FCC provider, call +1(706) 545-4868 .

  "Home Based Businesses\n\nHome Based Businesses Interested in operating a Home-Based Business (HBBs) or planning a fundraiser? Home Based Businesses (HBBs) are an important contributor to Army Family quality of life – new changes to procedures makes it easier and quicker gain approval to operate an on-post HBB. What is Home Based Businesses? Delegation of Authority to Approve Home Based Business Applications Memorandum Home Based Businesses and Home Based Cottages Food Businesses Memorandum HBBs allow Families to work from their Army quarters, developing rewarding careers that follow them through PCS moves. The wide span of HBBs operated by Army Families includes: Car repair/service Hairdressing and hairstyling Home baking and meal preparation Pet grooming and pet sitting Massage therapy Retail sales from home HBB owners need to obtain approval from the Garrison Commander or Senior Commander. We’ve recently streamlined the process to make it quicker and easier. Not everyone who works from home operates an HBB though. If you work remotely from your home, you probably don’t need approval. Other examples of businesses that don’t need approval are: Bookkeeping and tax preparation Personal training conducted outside the home Family Child Care Photography, graphic design, and advertising services Entertainment or travel planning Selling items from multi-level marketing (MLM) companies Home Based Business approval is quick and easy! The Army’s new standardized HBB application template streamlines the approval process.  Of course, installations are still required to adhere to local and state laws and regulations regarding home business operations, so check into those, too. Here’s the Process Step 1: Obtain the HBB Application. Visit your local Army Community Service or download your HBB application online .  Please fill out the fillable PDF. Step 2: Complete the Application. This includes visiting and obtaining approval from installation agencies like the community housing manager and safety office. The application will identify the agencies, but ask your ACS representative if you have questions. Step 3: Collect Other Requirements. Applicants must submit the following documents when submitting their HBB Applications: Business information (i.e. catalogs, brochures, or handouts) and a copy of liability insurance page and/or business registration number (if applicable). Cottage Food businesses must provide a written document containing: address of business, list of the Cottage Foods, a copy of the recipe for each food, and the method of advertising. Step 4: Turn in the Application & Required Documents. Once you’ve completed your paperwork, submit the application to the Information, Referral and Follow-up Office at Army Community Service. Keep a copy of the completed application for your own records. Once you’ve completed your paperwork, submit the application to the Information & Referral Office at Army Community Service, Building 7. Applicants can expect their approval/disapproval no later than 60 calendar days following their submission.
